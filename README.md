## Problem Statement
Permaculture planning requires understanding complex relationships between plants, animals, climate zones, and ecological guilds. This system provides intelligent recommendations based on location-specific conditions.

## Tech Stack
- Database: PostgreSQL (relational data with complex associations)
- Backend: Node.js/Express or Python/Flask
- Frontend: React or simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- AI Integration: OpenAI API or similar for natural language queries
- Deployment: TBD

## Features
- Climate zone-based plant/animal recommendations
- Guild association matching (companion planting)
- Natural language query interface
- System design recommendations

## Repository Structure
```
/docs - Design documents and ERD
/src - Source code
/data - Seed data and migrations
LOG.md - Time tracking
```
